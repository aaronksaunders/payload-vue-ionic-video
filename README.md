In this video series, we will set up PayloadCMS Headless CMS, create a Customers collection, log in as a Customer, create an account as a Customer. Then build a simple vuejs website that can login using the API created by PayloadCMS and finally look at the changes needed to go from website to mobile application with Ionic Framework.


[PayloadCMS](https://payloadcms.com/) - The best way to build a modern backend + admin UI. No black magic, all TypeScript, and fully open-source, Payload is both an app framework and a headless CMS.  @payloadcms  

[Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) - The mobile SDK for the Web.
An open-source mobile UI toolkit for building modern, high-quality cross-platform mobile apps from a single code base in React.Vue.Angular.  @IonicFramework  

**The Series**
- Part One will take us through to logging in with Customer collection from a vuejs web application
- Part Two - Coming Soon - will handle account creation and checking for existing user session
- Part Three - Coming Soon - Migrating to mobile app, managing JWT for authenticated access

Payload is a headless CMS

From PayloadCMS Documentation - A headless CMS is a system that sticks to what it's good atâ€”managing content. It concentrates solely on granting administrators an effective way to author and maintain content, but doesn't control how and where that content is used.
